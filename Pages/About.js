            Is there anything better than a new pair of shoes? <b>We don't think so. </b> 
            Our vision from the beginning was to make shopping for shoes easier 
            and deliver them to your door the next day, ready do be worn to that
            important dinner the same night. We have provided that service since 
            our start in 2009 and our love for shoes has grown even bigger each day. 
            Our goal is to promote quality before quantity and always use "green delivery"
            to keep our recurring customers coming back and to make the new ones return.
            Don't hesitate to be a part of our shoe-loving world!
